Forked from <https://ginpei.github.io/hannya-roll/> (https://github.com/ginpei/hannya-roll)

## Compare to origin version

- Remove auto animation.
- Add grabing scroll effect.
- Add a persist counter (click the counter number to reset).

## Notes

- Counter is not very accurate. It is hard to calculate scroll distances correctly. Feel free to talk with me about that:)
